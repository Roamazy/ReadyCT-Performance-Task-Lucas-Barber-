*Starting Materials folder

*ReadyCT Performance Task Code (Lucas Barber)
	
 	-- All code for each task in a single jupyter notebook
	
 	-- Each task has its code section labeled with a markdown cell
 

*ReadyCT Performance Tasks Workbook (Lucas Barber)
	
	 -- Each task dataframe was saved to its own sheet in this workbook

 	-- I saved each task to a csv at each stage out of habit!
